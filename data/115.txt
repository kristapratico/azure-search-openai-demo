Talks: Interactive Software Documentation, with PyScript Friday - May 17th, 2024 4:30 p.m.-5 p.m. in Room 301-305   Presented by:  Valerio Maggio  Description Software Documentation is one of the most crucial component of an open source software, as it determines either the adoption or the failure of the project. For this reason, a big effort is currently devoted in the community to support and sustain an entire ecosystem of documentation tools and frameworks (e.g. diataxis).  Good examples of great software docs certainly include Django framework, or Scikit-learn, whose examples are made available for interactive execution in Jupyter-like environments. Nevertheless,  recent advances to Python on WASM enables unprecedented scenarios for interactivity, giving users the ability to run code directly in the browser, with no setup required, and without leaving the documentation at all! This is the angle I would like to explore with this talk, with particular emphasis on the PyScript platform.  In fact PyScript integrates multiple interpreters; it features a new Pythonic API for the DOM; supports non-blocking execution threads using WebWorkers; and ships core-plugins providing Python Terminals, and notebook-like code editors running directly in the browser. All those features fit perfectly in the context of interactive documentation, and will be demonstrated in action in this talk as proof-of-principle.
