Talks: Graphs and Vogue Dance: using data structures to create choreographies Sunday - May 19th, 2024 1:45 p.m.-2:15 p.m. in Ballroom BC   Presented by:  Alynne Ferreira  Description Vogue Dance is a dance form that emerged in LGBTQIA+ culture and has become a global phenomenon, full of complex movements, creativity and social connections. Graphs are powerful tools for analyzing and visualizing interconnected networks. To organize a choreography using graphs, you first need to create a directed graph that represents the sequence of movements in the choreography. Each node will have a picture that represents a specific pose, and each edge represents the connection between the poses. The sequence used to change from one pose to the next will represent the movement. Graphs can be used to facilitate the creation of a choreography, allowing you to visualize the sequence of movements and the relationship between them. At the end of this lecture, we hope to put together a choreography based on the poses presented. The order of the poses can be chosen manually or generated at random.
