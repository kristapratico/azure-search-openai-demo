Talks: Python and Data Storytelling to the Rescue: Let's Avoid More Deaths by PowerPoint Saturday - May 18th, 2024 noon-12:30 p.m. in Ballroom A   Presented by:  Sebasti√°n Flores  Description Abstract: Over the past few years, I have experimented with various presentation formats (jupyter notebook + RISE, streamlit, and quarto) and graphic libraries (matplotlib, seaborn, altair, powerbi, tableau, vizzu) in search of greater interactivity when presenting and teaching. At the same time, I became very interested in the related topic of data storytelling, which focuses on the skills and hacks to make a presentation memorable and impactful. I think this combination of concepts (Python and Data Storytelling) is innovative and has not been sufficiently explored and taught. During the talk, I will share insights and suggestions on different skills and technical tools that we can use to create more engaging, entertaining, and memorable presentations using Python libraries and programs. Let's make the world better, one presentation at a time!
