Q: Are there limits to how much funding I may receive?A: PyCon US strives to provide assistance to as many applicants as possible by optimizing the funds we have available for travel grants. Recipients receive support for some or all of their expenses including travel, hotel, and meal per diems. While we wish we could give grants to everyone who applies, our funds are limited.Please review your travel plans and adjust the amount requested to $2,000 USD or less for international travel and $1,500 or less for US domestic travel. The online-only option to attend PyCon US 2024 will be offered again for folks who cannot attend in person or require more than the travel grant cap. Please let us know if there are extenuating circumstances that may make the trip more expensive.Possible ways to reduce expenses:Conference Registration Fees should not be included in your requested amount. If you are awarded financial aid a complimentary conference ticket will be provided.Adjust travel dates to obtain lower airfare.If an in-person visit to PyCon US is still out of your financial means, consider attending our virtual PyCon US or a PyCon local to you.If you have already submitted an initial request, you may adjust it by logging in to the travel grant dashboard. Please make adjustments to your application by February 4, 2024. Feel free to contact us with any questions. Q: If I request more funds after my grant has been approved, will that affect my current grant?A: If you cannot attend with your current award, you may request additional funds through your PyCon US dashboard, instead of accepting or declining your grant. We cannot guarantee that we will be able to accommodate you because our budget is tightly stretched. Requesting additional funds puts you into the second funding round where we distribute remaining funds from people who have declined their awards.You may also consider attending PyCon US virtually.Please note that if you are requesting more funds and we are unable to allocate more funds, your previous award will no longer be available; this option is only intended for people who would not be able to attend PyCon US on their current grant.

Q: What if I need help with a US visitor visa?A: PyCon US can provide you with a “Visa Letter” or an “Invitation Letter” to support a United States visitor visa application. Visa letters can be requested once you have a fully paid and confirmed conference registration. The letter confirms that as a registered delegate, you are invited to attend by the Python Software Foundation (PSF) and the PyCon US 2024 Committee.Invitation letters can be requested in lieu of a “Visa Letter” if you do not have a confirmed, paid conference registration and are still waiting to register for any reason at the time of your request. The letter serves as an invitation from the Python Software Foundation (PSF) and the PyCon US 2024 Committee to register for and attend the conference, but cannot confirm your participation.Please fill out this form to request a Visa Letter or an Invitation Letter. Q: Can I be reimbursed for food?A: The Travel Grant Committee automatically adds a per-diem rate for food for each travel grant recipient. Please do not submit meal receipts. For 2024, the US GSA (Governmental Services Administration) set the per-diem rate for Pittsburgh, PA at $64 per day. Per-diems only cover the days you are attending PyCon US and one travel day before and after conference attendance. For conference days, because breakfast and lunches are provided, we only provide 1/2 the per diem ($32 per day). For tutorial and sprint days, because lunches are provided, we provide 3/4 the per diem ($48 per day). Q: How do I provide a hotel receipt when I haven’t checked out yet?A: A reservation confirmation may be submitted as a receipt. The reservation confirmation should include the name and address of the hotel/motel/hostel/AirBnB, check-in and check-out dates, number of occupants, and the amount charged per day. Reimbursement is limited to the proportionate, per-person cost if the room has more than one occupant. Q: Can I be reimbursed for auto expenses or mileage if I am driving to PyCon US?A: Yes.

Q: What if my receipt is larger than my grant amount?A: You can upload a receipt for an amount larger than your grant, but you will only be reimbursed up to the award amount. Q: Should I register for the conference before I find out if my travel grant application has been approved?A: No. Applicants do not need to register in the fear that the conference will sell out!
