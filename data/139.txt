Talks: Build in-browser 3D experiences with WebGL and PyScript Friday - May 17th, 2024 5:15 p.m.-5:45 p.m. in Room 301-305   Presented by:  ≈Åukasz Langa  Description Did you know you can write Python to write no-nonsense 3D games and interactive experiences that run entirely in the Web browser? Python's original killer app used to be ZOPE, an environment to create dynamic websites before "content management system" was even a term. Now, in 2024, the rules have changed. Web apps are predominantly client-side, and JavaScript rules that use case. It doesn't have to be like this! You've probably heard about PyScript and maybe seen an intro or two. This talk is something else. I will show you a deep dive into a single topic: how to use PyScript with WebGL to harness the graphical power of the Web browser. By the end of the talk, I expect you to gain confidence that you can do it, too, and be inspired to try! The talk assumes familiarity with Python and high-school math.
