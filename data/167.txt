Talks: Creative Coding with py5, the Python version of Processing Saturday - May 18th, 2024 4:15 p.m.-4:45 p.m. in Room 301-305   Presented by:  James Schmitz  Description py5 is a framework for doing creative coding in Python that is very similar to the widely used Java framework Processing. The goal of this talk is to introduce py5 to the Python community and demonstrate how it can be used for data visualization, art, and education. It is accessible to beginners while also being capable of supporting professional artists creating digital art that is shown in galleries. By design, py5 is integrated into the Python ecosystem, working well with popular Python libraries such as numpy, matplotlib, PIL, shapely, and trimesh.
