Over the years I have produced diagrams, charts, illustrations and other graphics to help people understand sophisticated project concepts. This includes project architecture, standard operating procedures, coding concepts, sprints and roadmaps. You will be guided through ways of how to make stylized examples of your project code and workflows in easy to follow examples. By using common software for illustrations along with some simple guidelines you too can make easy to follow visual content for your next project. Key Takeaways: Learn methods to visually communicate with your team including with color, shapes, images, gifs and even memes to help get a point across Understand how to make your technical documentation into visual graphics with diagram design style guides See examples of using libraries like Sphinx, Pydoc, and PlantUML to help make great diagrams Come away with an ability to execute a simple (or sophisticated) graphic with essential steps and key requirements
