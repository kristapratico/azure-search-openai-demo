Talks: Making Your Documentation Interactive with PyScript Friday - May 17th, 2024 11 a.m.-11:30 a.m. in Ballroom A   Presented by:  Jeff Glass  Description The documentation for your Python package is already peppered with examples â€“ what if users could run them in an interactive REPL, right inside the online documentation? With PyScript, developers can add an interactive Python session to any webpage, including integration with Sphinx, MkDocs, readthedocs, and GitHub Pages. Your documentation examples become an interactive learning session with zero backend or installation. In this talk, you will learn how to enhance your Python web documentation by making it interactive and runnable anywhere, in a fully serverless way.
