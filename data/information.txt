Registration costs go towards offsetting costs for catering, audio visual, recording, internet, and other miscellaneous costs. By offsetting those costs, we can offer attendees reasonable registration rates and offer a travel grant program to those that need it.Furthermore, the revenue that PyCon US generates is used to run the Python Software Foundation. The Python Software Foundation runs PyCon US, gives out over $300k in grants per year to Python groups around the world, houses critical community infrastructure such as PyPI and python.org, and launches programs like the CPython Developer in Residence. To read more about what the PSF does and its finances, check out the 2022 Annual Impact Report.What’s included in my registration?Summits and Sponsor Presentations - May 16, 2024Morning coffee, break refreshments, and lunch is served each daySponsor Workshops are sessions provided by our sponsors.
