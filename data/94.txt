Talks: Acknowledging Women’s Contributions in the Python Community Through Podcast Friday - May 17th, 2024 5:15 p.m.-5:45 p.m. in Hall C   Presented by:  Cheuk Ting Ho Georgi Ker Mariatta Tereza Iofciu  Description The Python community has been making efforts in improving the diversity and representation among its members. There are examples of success stories such as PyCon US Charlas, PyLadies, Djangonaut, and Django Girls. Yet in the Python podcast community, women are still underrepresented, making up only 17% of invited guests among the popular podcast series. Being a guest in a podcast is a privilege, and an opportunity to influence the Python community. There are many women and underrepresented group members who have made impactful contributions to the Python community globally, and they deserve the recognition and to be heard by the rest of us. Disheartened by the lack of representation by women on Python podcasts, and inspired by others who have shown us how diversity in the community can be improved through intentionality, we decided to start a podcast with a goal to highlight their voices so that they could receive the recognition they deserve. In this talk,earn about them, and about our podcast series. We’ll also share how you can further help out cause in improving representation and diversity in the Python community.  Goal To raise awareness of the underrepresentation of certain groups, especially women. To acknowledge the progress made by the Python community and what can be done further to continue the improvement. Target Audience Anyone who cares about the diversity and inclusion progression in the Python community. Community leaders who want to be allies.
