Talks: Python ate my Homework! Friday - May 17th, 2024 2 p.m.-2:30 p.m. in Hall C   Presented by:  Evan Kohilas  Description Is your relationship with maths... complicated? Do you hate doing simple, repetitive, error prone calculations that you know your computer could trivially do? Have you ever been disappointed by Wolfram Alpha's inability to calculate your problems with working out? Then book this session, and I'll show you the basics of SymPy, and cover some university level math solutions by demonstrating a calculator to solve and print working out for them. Iâ€™ll also present how Jupyter can be used to display and submit parts of your assignment, and finally how you can help contribute to the computational maths community.
