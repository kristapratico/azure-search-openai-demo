Talks: How to amplify diversity inside a Python community? Friday - May 17th, 2024 4:30 p.m.-5 p.m. in Hall C   Presented by:  Juliana (Jules) Barros Lima  Description I once heard the question of whether there was a real need to create more support subgroups for minorities in Python: whether, at the end of the day, the community would be more segregated than united. When I passed this on to a few people, a new demand emerged: that there were difficulties in creating more diverse teams. Based on the organization of meetups, regional events and ethnographic research among different tech communities, this talk seeks not only to present possible solutions for increasing diversity in python environments (such as academia, companies and communities), but also to instigate debate about where we can improve and how to truly listen to pythonistas. This talk also aims to explore already established tools - such as the Code of Conduct - and evolve them in the light of new minorities and to provide a safe space for learning and connections.
