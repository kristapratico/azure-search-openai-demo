 Humble Data Workshop    Are you eager to embark on a tech career but unsure where to start? Are you curious about data science? Taking the first steps in this area is hard, but you don’t have to do it alone. Join our workshop for complete beginners and get started in Python data science - even if you’ve never written a single line of code! We invite those from underrepresented groups to join us for a fun, supportive workshop that will give you the confidence to get started in this exciting area. You can expect plenty of exercises, as well as inspiring talks from those who were once in your shoes. You’ll cover the basics of programming in Python, as well as useful libraries and tools such as Jupyter notebooks, pandas, and Matplotlib. In this hands-on workshop you’ll work through a series of beginner-friendly materials at your own pace. You’ll work within small groups, each with an assigned mentor, who will be there to help you with any questions or whenever you get stuck. All you’ll need to bring is a laptop that can connect to the internet and a willingness to learn! Humble Data aims to increase inclusivity and provide a safe community for Python and Data Science. We organise free workshops for people who are outside of the mainstream in the data science and tech industry. We encourage past participants to become mentors and even organise their own workshop one day. We are building a community where people can help and learn from each other. Remember to stay humble!
