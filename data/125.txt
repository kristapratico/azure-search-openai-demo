Talks: Hybrid Quantum-Classical Machine Learning using Qiskit Saturday - May 18th, 2024 5 p.m.-5:30 p.m. in Ballroom BC   Presented by:  Naveed Mahmud  Description Qiskit is a python-based open-source toolkit for working with quantum computers. In this talk, we describe our work of developing a hybrid Quantum-Classical Machine Learning (ML) framework using Qiskit. This talk will cover how to build quantum circuits and classical models for ML tasks such as text classification and sentiment analysis.
