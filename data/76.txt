Talks: Procedurally Generated Monsters! A complete example of Python game development Friday - May 17th, 2024 3:30 p.m.-4 p.m. in Hall C   Presented by:  Esther Alter  Description This is a talk about how to develop a game in Python such that you'll be able to take a cool idea all the way to a Steam release. Nearly every talk about game dev tools will introduce the tool (such as pygame) and conclude with a minimal example ("press the arrow keys to move the square"). This talk isn’t about moving a square; it’s about everything else. More specifically, it's a talk about everything else in Python. I've made three Python games and several others in other languages--in this talk, I will explain why Python is often the best tool for gamemaking. I made a procedurally-generated monster collecting game in Python that I released on itch.io and Steam. This talk is about how I made decisions over the course of nine months to ensure that development was fast, testing was robust, graphical effects were weird, and gameplay was fun.
