Talks: Combining Django ORM & FastAPI in a Single App Saturday - May 18th, 2024 11:15 a.m.-11:45 a.m. in Ballroom A   Presented by:  Mia Bajić  Description Django is the most extensive Python framework, which is also very opinionated and synchronous. In contrast, FastAPI emerges as a more recent, asynchronous framework. As a developer and the maintainer of several services, one of which is a data visualization tool deployed in production across various companies, I have had the unique opportunity to use Django ORM with FastAPI. If you take a look through GitHub or other resources, you’ll notice there’s not much out there about combining Django and FastAPI — it’s a bit of an unconventional setup. The aim of my talk is to share insights from my experience with this setup, highlighting its practical implementation and the lessons learned along the way. This talk is aimed at programmers from beginners to more experienced ones familiar with either of these frameworks. You’ll gain insights into combining asynchronous frameworks with synchronous ones, along with understanding the benefits and challenges of this approach.
