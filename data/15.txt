Talks: Connecting Old to New with CircuitPython: Retrocomputer input devices on modern PCs Sunday - May 19th, 2024 1:45 p.m.-2:15 p.m. in Hall C   Presented by:  Jeff Epler  Description The input devices of decades past hold nostalgic value for many folks. But they don't need to merely sit on a shelf as museum objects—they can be reverse engineered and then adapted to modern computers. CircuitPython, an implementation of the Python language for microcontrollers, is an excellent language for projects like these, thanks to native USB Human Interface Device (HID) support and the ability to ‘bitbang’ archaic interfaces combined with the fast development cycle of an interpreted language, as you'll learn in case studies adapting these keyboards & mice. No previous experience with CircuitPython is necessary. Some knowledge of electronics will enhance your enjoyment of this talk, though there will be a quick summary of key electronics concepts as the talk proceeds.
