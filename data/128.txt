Talks: Unlocking the Parallel Universe: Subinterpreters and Free-Threading in Python 3.13 Sunday - May 19th, 2024 2:30 p.m.-3 p.m. in Ballroom A   Presented by:  Anthony Shaw  Description Python 3.12 introduced a new parallel execution model called "sub interpreters" that uses a per-interpreter GIL to unlock a new way of writing parallel code that's faster than multiprocessing. Python 3.13 introduces another new parallel execution model called "free-threading" (previously called no-gil) that replaces that optionally removes the GIL so that threads can truly be parallel. Does free-threading make sub interpreters redundant? We'll answer that question in this talk. We unpack what sub interpreters are, how to use them and their limitations. We'll explore free-threading, the optional flag to remove the GIL in 3.13.  Finally we look at a use case for sub interpreters and free-threading together, a multi-worker, multi-thread ASGI web server. We benchmark this against traditional web server architecture with multiprocessing and threading. So fasten your seatbelts, fellow Pythonistas! Letâ€™s ride the comet tail of parallelism, leaving behind the single-threaded past. ðŸš€âœ¨
