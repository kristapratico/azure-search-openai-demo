Talks: The Design of Everyday APIs Friday - May 17th, 2024 12:30 p.m.-1 p.m. in Room 301-305   Presented by:  Lynn Root  Description What makes a good API for a library? Or more importantly, what makes an API bad?  Implementing an API is an art. Itâ€™s the connection between the user and the library itself. How can we optimize that connection to make the experience more pleasing? What makes a user reach for one library over another? What goes into an ergonomic API? This talk will discuss what makes an API good: simplicity, consistency, and flexibility. We will apply those principles by iterating and improving on a real world example, ending with a library that is delightful to work with.
