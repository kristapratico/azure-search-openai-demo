We are looking to find pairs in the same timezone or even in the same country to make meeting a bit simpler.Once folks are paired up, we will introduce mentors and mentees via email, ask mentees to share prepared material, and recommend that review happen asynchronously. We know folks are busy so we are recommending everyone start with asynchronous review and take it from there. If folks want to schedule video calls or virtual check-ins, they can do so on their own.
