 Lightning Talks    WHAT'S A LIGHTNING TALK?Lightning talks are a maximum duration of 5 minutes on any topic of interest to other Python people. It doesn't have to be about something that you wrote, it can be something that you learned, or a technique you think other people will be interested in.You know that thing at work that everyone comes to you for help with? Talk about that!You know that thing you just learned that helped you out? Talk about that!You know that thing you always wish you understood, but haven't figured out yet? Talk about that!Slides are encouraged but not required!THINGS PEOPLE SAY WHEN THEY THINK THEY CAN'T DO A LIGHTNING TALK"Everyone already knows THING_X"No, they don't.They think they do, but you have a better understanding than they do, and they will learn something.Even if they do, it's interesting to hear another person's explanation."Iâ€™m not an expert at anything"You know more than you think you do.You don't have to be an expert, you just have to be interested enough to talk for 5 minutes.You can do a 1-minute lightning talk if you want."It's scary talking in front of people"Yes, but you will feel really accomplished when you've done it.Folks at PyCon US are super-friendly and are always welcoming of new speakers.Everyone is nervous speaking in public, even people you think are not.You can give a lightning talk without talking!"I have an idea but it's no good"It's a better idea than you think.Are there really any bad ideas for lightning talks? :)LIGHTNING TALKS AT PYCON US 2024Each day we put out poster boards next to the registration desk for people to submit their ideas. At lunch-time we select speakers who will be notified via email that they have a slot at that evening's lightning talks or the following morning's lightning talks.LIGHTNING TALK SCHEDULEFriday, May 17, 6:00pm - 7:00pm ESTSaturday, May 18, 8:00am - 8:50am ESTSaturday, May 18, 5:45pm - 6:45pm ESTSunday, May 19, 8:00am - 8:50am EST
