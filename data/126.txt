Talks: Continuous Deployment and Release of Django Apps Friday - May 17th, 2024 2 p.m.-2:30 p.m. in Ballroom BC   Presented by:  Vinicius Mendes  Description If you have a Django app in production and you need to evolve it, how do you ensure your app will keep running while you refactor your models, run migrations, deploy partially implemented features, and change your APIs' contracts? In this talk, I will present strategies my team has applied for all these scenarios with safe migrations, feature flags and switches, and intermediary API contracts.
