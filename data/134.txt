Talks: Visual Data Storytelling with Blender and Python Saturday - May 18th, 2024 10:30 a.m.-11 a.m. in Ballroom A   Presented by:  Neeraj Pandey Manoj Pandey  Description You might have encountered beautiful animations and data storytelling through many educators and experimentalists online and wondered if itâ€™s only done in javascript or could also be done by Python. In this talk, the attendees will learn how to blend the 3D animation power of Blender with the 2D plotting capabilities from Python libraries like matplotlib, plotly, seaborn, etc. We will demonstrate some practical techniques to create immersive 3D models with Blender and enhance them with detailed 2D plots, providing a comprehensive narrative for data interpretation. By integrating these data-viz tools, devs and data enthusiasts will discover new & impactful ways to leverage Python to present and communicate their data insights from educational and work projects.
