For the details, see our PyCon Recording Release.GUIDELINES FOR PROPOSAL SUBMISSIONEveryone is encouraged to submit a proposal, regardless of experience level. PyCon US thrives on having talks ranging from introductory to advanced. If you are reading this, and you are interested in speaking at PyCon US, we want you to submit a proposal.Before writing up a proposal, read the following descriptions of the four kinds of presentations at PyCon US — Talks, Charlas, Tutorials, and Posters — and follow the individual page links for the proposal kind that best suits your topic.Important Note: Proposal submissions that are solely or to a large extent written or include AI-generated text by a large-scale language model (LLM) such as ChatGPT will not be accepted and disregarded without a second chance to submit.All speakers are expected to have read and adhere to the conference Code of Conduct. In particular for speakers: slide contents and spoken material should be appropriate for a professional audience including people of many different backgrounds. Sexual language and imagery are not appropriate, and neither is language or imagery that denigrates or demeans people based on race, gender, religion, sexual orientation, physical appearance, disability, or body size, or any other dimension of diversity.PyCon US does not want expenses to discourage you from submitting a proposal and speaker travel grants ensure that if assistance is needed and your proposal is accepted you can speak at PyCon US. When you create a speaker profile, check the box to indicate that you require a speaker grant. This is not seen by the proposal reviewers and does not affect the review of your proposal.After proposals are selected, we’ll reach out to you regarding your needs. We understand situations can change and we are here for you. If you have any questions, let us know at pycon-aid@python.org.TALKSThese are the traditional talk sessions given during the main conference days, Friday through May 17- 19, 2024.PyCon US is dedicated to featuring a diverse and inclusive mix of speakers in the lineup.We will make every effort to provide accommodations for speakers and attendees of all abilities — all we ask is that you let us know so we can prepare accordingly.Most talks are 30 minutes long, but we do offer a limited number of 45-minute slots for important topics that promise to benefit from a more extensive treatment. We organize the schedule into five “tracks”, grouping talks by topic and having them in the same room for consecutive sessions.Learn more: Proposing a TalkCHARLASPyCon US Charlas (“charla” is the Spanish word for conference “talk”) will be a full day track of Python talks en Español at PyCon US and open to the entire Python community.If you can speak Spanish, why not submit a proposal for a charla? If you speak Spanish as a second, third, or twelfth language, please do not hesitate to participate! The call for proposals opens with the rest of the CFP.Learn more: PyCon CharlasTUTORIALSAs with the talks, we are looking for tutorials that can grow this community at any level. We aim for tutorials that will advance Python, advance this community, and shape the future. Each tutorial session runs for 3 full hours plus a break for coffee or tea. There is both a morning tutorial session and an afternoon tutorial session on the two days preceding the main conference — this year, the tutorial days are Wednesday and Thursday, May 15- 16, 2023 in the same venue that hosts the main conference days that follow.Attention full-time trainers: Please bring your coursework to PyCon US. Every year we get several educators that bring their show on the road, so show us what you have on the syllabus for 2024.As tutorials are longer than talks and are in an interactive classroom-like setting, they require much more preparation. Due to the amount of work involved, tutorial instructors are compensated. There is a limit of at most two tutorials given by one presenter.Learn more: Proposing a TutorialPOSTERSThis year, posters will be displayed during the open Expo Hall hours of the conference.A poster is a presentation of a topic on a 8′×4′ poster board. As attendees mingle through the rows, they find interesting topics, read through them, then strike up a discussion. As with the other proposal types, we are really looking to you to talk about what’s going on in this community and tell everyone where it is going. If you are doing something awesome, share it!Learn more: Proposing a PosterWHERE TO SUBMIT YOUR PROPOSALPlease review our submission instructions for more details and guidelines on submitting your proposal on Pretalx.Due to the competitive selection process, we encourage prospective speakers to submit their proposals as early as possible as it allows for feedback prior to the CFP deadline.PyCon US is using Pretalx again in 2024.
