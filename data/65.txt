Talks: Making Beautiful, Publication Quality Tables in Python is Possible in 2024 Friday - May 17th, 2024 11:45 a.m.-12:15 p.m. in Ballroom BC   Presented by:  Michael Chow Richard Iannone  Description Tables are undeniably useful for data work. We have many excellent DataFrame libraries in Python and they give us the flexibility to manipulate data to our hearts content. But what happens when comes to presenting tables to others? The display of tables can be beautiful. Tables can convey information effectively, just as plots do and, sometimes, it’s the better way to present data. Truly, the time has come to bridge the divide between raw DataFrame output and wondrously-structured tables suitable for publication. Let's review the state of ‘display tables’ in 2024. We’ll go over which table components make for effective displays of information. It’s surprising but there are many considerations that go into making a well-crafted table. We’ll take a look at the combinations of Python packages that fit together to make this important task possible, and marvel together at the tabular results they can provide.
