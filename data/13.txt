Talks: Weaving algorithms: the threads that bind the python and textile communities Saturday - May 18th, 2024 4:15 p.m.-4:45 p.m. in Ballroom A   Presented by:  Kelsey Vavasour  Description There are a lot of curious crossovers between programming and fiber arts, from the origins of punch cards to borrowed terminology and shared cultural mores. Computing drew a surprising amount from fiber arts, and as I began programming and knitting around the same time I was fascinated to consider things such as how knitting patterns can be viewed with the same conceptual framework as programs, and that understanding how to modify one can provide interesting insights to the other. Both the Python and textile communities are also wonderfully diverse and put some very important efforts in place to encourage inclusivity, which has helped lead me to feel comfortable sharing these insights with such a large audience. This talk aims to get people thinking a bit outside the box and understanding connections with communities they might not have interacted with before.
