 Development Sprints    WHEN WILL SPRINTS TAKE PLACE?Monday, May 20, 2024 8:00am – Thursday, May 23, 2024 11:00pm EST - Sprints will be held in rooms 308-311 and 315-321 and are free to attend with a PyCon US registration. NOTE: Please be familiar with the PyCon US Health & Safety Guidelines. Sprint days are part of the conference and only registered attendees of PyCon US can participate due to the guidelines put in place for the 2024 conference.Development sprints are a key part of PyCon US, and a chance for the contributors to open-source projects to get together face-to-face for four days of intensive learning, development and camaraderie. Newbies sit with gurus, go out for lunch and dinner together, and have a great time while advancing their project.Why not join the sprints this year at PyCon US? by Naomi CederWHAT'S A SPRINT?PyCon US Development Sprints are four days of intensive learning and development on an open source project of your choice, in a team environment. It's a time to come together with colleagues, old and new, to share what you've learned and apply it to an open source project.In the crucible of a sprint room, teaming with both focus and humor, it's a time to test, fix bugs, add new features, and improve documentation. And it's a time to network, make friends, and build relationships that go beyond the conference.PyCon US provides the space and infrastructure (network, power, tables & chairs); you bring your skills, humanity, and brainpower (oh! and don't forget your computer).WHO CAN PARTICIPATE?You! All experience levels are welcome; sprints are a great opportunity to get connected with, and start contributing to your favorite Python project. Participation in the sprints is free and included in your conference registration. Please go to your attendee profile on your dashboard and indicate the number of sprint days you will be attending.WHO CAN RUN A SPRINT?You! If you've never run a sprint before, the In-Person Event Handbook is an excellent guide.Instructions for adding a sprint project to this page are below.WHAT'S THE SCHEDULE?Sprints run all day from Monday, May 20th through Thursday, May 23rd. That's 8:00am to 11:00pm EST. Lunch will be provided.WHERE WILL THE SPRINTS BE?The Sprints will take place at the David L. Lawrence Convention Center. Each Sprinting project will claim its own room or if the room is large enough, it will share the space with other Sprinting Projects.WHICH PROJECTS ARE SPRINTING?If you are interested in leading a sprint, please add your project using the link below:Please submit a sprint here and add a brief description of your project that will be listed below. Include links to what you'll be sprinting on. Indicate if the sprint will be newcomer friendly!HAVE QUESTIONS NOT COVERED HERE?Reach out to pycon-sprints@python.org          GNU Mailman       Mailman is free software for managing electronic mail discussion and e-newsletter lists. Mailman is integrated with the web, making it easy for users to manage their accounts and for list owners to administer their lists. Mailman supports built-in archiving, automatic bounce processing, content filtering, digest delivery, spam filters, and more.  We have beginner friendly issues in both our core engine and our Django based web UI.

Commitizen assumes your team uses a standard way of committing rules. From that foundation, it can bump your project's version, create the changelog, and update files.  By default, commitizen uses conventional commits, but you can build your own set of rules and publish them.  Using a standardized set of rules to write commits makes commits easier to read and enforces writing descriptive commits.

We'd love to have you submit a talk! Are you interested in submitting a talk, but you don't know where to start? Do you have an idea already, and you'd like some guidance on the submission process? We're hosting a Sprint where PyOhio organizers and past speakers will work with you on submitting your presentation. We can't write your talk for you, but we can help you shore up your submission and guide you through the process. Join us on Monday, May 20, and get your talk idea submitted to PyOhio 2024!

Our goal for this Sprint Project is to develop more Dash app examples for the community. Currently there are 91 examples. Our aim is to reach 100 example apps.   We will work with the project's GitHub repo: https://github.com/AnnMarieW/dash-app-gallery  This Sprint is open to all. Dash experience will likely lead to more apps created, but Python newcomers are welcome to join as well, because learning to build apps with Dash takes 20 minutes. If you are new to Dash, make sure to review this tutorial before the Sprint: https://dash.plotly.com/tutorial  If approved, the Sprint will take place on Monday, May 20, at 8am, and it will be led by Plotly's Community Manager, Adam Schroeder.

No matter your level of experience, we have something you can work on; and all contributors get a Challenge Coin!        Submitted by Russell              | Anchor link           RouteE       RouteE is a suite of open-source tools developed by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL). The primary tools that will be included in the sprint are RouteE Powertrain and RouteE Compass. RouteE Powertrain enables researchers to obtain energy estimates for any vehicle type—including existing and futuristic vehicles—for trips or routes where detailed drive cycle data may be unavailable. RouteE Compass is an energy-aware routing engine that uses RouteE Powertrain to predict energy consumption during shortest path searches and allows exploration of energy/time tradeoffs in route planning.  We'll be sprinting on a variety of general issues and fixes as well as some new functionality.

How then, are comic related? The "How to Contribute To NumPy" comics follows riveting story of three grad students as they learn not only how to use NumPy in their research, but also the emotional ups and downs!  Join us in making comics! Take a copy of the NumPy comics and give feedback. Take the challenge and try making your own comics for your open source projects! Bounce off story ideas, sketch, write a script. Pens, paper, and other tactile tools will be provided.   This sprint will run on Monday, May 20. Newcomer friendly- no prior drawing or graphic design skills required!        Submitted by Mars Lee              | Anchor link
