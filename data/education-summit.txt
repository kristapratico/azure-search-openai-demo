 Education Summit    In 2024, PyCon US will be holding its 12th annual Python Education Summit in person!When: Thursday, May 16, 2024Time: 9 am to 4 pmWhere: David L. Lawrence Convention Center - Room 403/404The Summit is a gathering of teachers and educators focused on bringing coding literacy, through Python, to as many learners as possible. We invite educators from all venues to join the discussion, share insights, learn new techniques and tools, and share their passion for education. We invite educators from across the globe and from every educational sector to join us in sharing, learning, and innovating at the intersection of Python and education. In addition to a wide array of engaging speakers, we will also create collaboration opportunities and hands-on learning sessions.Expanding Educational FrontiersThe theme for this year will be "Python Anywhere, Python Everywhere" which highlights an era where Python's dominance stretches across a multitude of fields, from data science and artificial intelligence to web development and beyond, its widespread adoption marks a significant shift in the coding landscape and therefore in coding education. This year, the advent of new coding assistants, such as Anaconda Assistant, PyCharm AI, Copilot, and ChatGPT has marked a significant advancement in how we teach, learn, and engage with code. We are calling on educators to share how Python is taught, ensuring that anyone, anywhere, can harness the power of coding.These lessons could include, but are not limited to:Simplifying complex coding tasks, making Python more accessible to beginners.Offering real-time feedback and suggestions, enhancing the learning process.Facilitating a deeper understanding of coding principles through interactive assistance.Enabling educators and learners to focus on creative problem-solving by reducing the initial barriers to entry.You are welcome to freely interpret Python Anywhere, Python Everywhere!PRESENTINGWe will have a track of talks during the morning session and a series of collaboration and tutorial sessions during the afternoon. We invite anyone interested in Python and education to submit proposals. Talks/collaboration ideas will be selected by a review committee.Talks: 20-minute talk + 5 minutes of questions (the schedule allows for an extra 5 minutes in case things run over)Collaboration/tutorials: These will be 30-60 minute work sessions, designed by a proposer. These may include:a working group to review/edit some open-source materialto outline the needs or structure for a specific set of best practicesforming a plan for ongoinga short workshop on a tool or technique, etc.Examples: using Python-based hardware for learning, reviewing modules or assessments in an open-access book, discussing best practices for certain teaching techniques, etc.Submit a proposal to speak at the Education Summit.GOALSThe goal of the Summit is to bring together leaders from multiple educational venues to:learn more about each otherâ€™s effortsgain useful insight from each otherform connections that might foster future collaborationidentify common issues and begin discussing ways to address themcreate an enhanced sense of unity, purpose, inclusion, and community among Python educatorsIt is our hope that the Summit will serve as a catalyst leading into the rest of PyCon US to encourage even more interaction - hallway discussions, open spaces, lightning talks, and sprints.Anyone attending this summit will gain a broader understanding of approaches, issues, resources, and challenges in teaching Python. They will also have the opportunity to contribute to the discussion and make connections with other teachers of Python from across the community.SCHEDULE AND FORMATThe Education Summit takes place on Thursday, May 16th.Our current schedule is below, all in Pittsburgh (Eastern) time:Morning Session9:00 - Opening remarks9:15 - Rise to the Challenge: Ariel Ortiz9:45 - Introduction to Python for Lawyers: Morgan Gray and Wes Oliver10:15 - The Source of Change: Kattni10:45 - Coffee/Tea/Snack/Stretch Break11:00 - Build a Textbook AI Assistant with Python: Husni Almoubayyed11:30 - ChatGPT, the Abacus, and Coding Education: Charlie Meyer12:00 - Lunch BreakAfternoon session1:00 - Afternoon Welcome1:15 - Lightning TalksDr. Marshall Miller2:30 - Extended SessionsAll of Our Students Belong in Tech: - Dora PalfiInvent with PyScript: Nick Tolervoy, Josh Lowe and MartinBirds of a Feather4:00 - ClosingInformal social events to followWHAT TO EXPECT?We encourage all attendees to engage in the dialogue.
